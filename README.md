Simple javascript game for the js13k competition. The 2017 theme is 'lost'. The game is embarrassingly simple, but also very addictive: keep your finger inside the box for as long as you can while touching the screen. The game works in a desktop browser (keep the mouse pointer inside the box) or a mobile browser (keep the finger inside the box). The box moves faster as you advance.

This game was conceptualized during a 1 and a half hour wait while trying to get gas when returning to Miami after Irma, and then developed as fast as I could once I got home on the 13th :D.
